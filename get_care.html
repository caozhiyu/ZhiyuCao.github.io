  <h3>Project for Postgraduate</h3>
  <b>This project is a Continuous project - 2020 S2</b>
  <br>
  <b>This project is to develop an app-based(web) communication and coordination tool that supports those receiving
    care services and primary Carers managing and accessing multiple providers.</b>
  <br>
  <b>The tool will allow a Carer to have visibility of all services and support being provided to the person being cared
    for in a calendar and schedule view (with ability to change appointments or request particular services for
    scheduled visits). Information presented will be linked directly to the source allowing dynamic updating (eg. the
    schedule of visits approved by an in-home support provider or weekly social activities the person being cared for
    is enrolled in).</b>
  <br>
  <b>Providers interacting with the person being cared for will be able to provide updates through the app (eg.
    completion of tasks assigned to an activity, ad-hoc notes, requests to the Carer).</b>
